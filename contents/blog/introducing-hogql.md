Today, we're excited to announce a major new feature which we're making available to all users as a public beta on PostHog Cloud. It's called HogQL and it's a new query language which makes it easier to interrogate your data directly.

Not only that, but the introduction of HogQL brings with it other updates, including a new event explorer (previously the Live Events view), and the ability to use HogQL expressions within insights. We think that PostHog's existing insights will remain valuable for the vast majority of queries, but HogQL is an alternative when they just don't fit the bill.

Speaking of bills, HogQL is free for all users while it's in public beta - all we ask is that you share any feedback you have with it either via the PostHog Slack, or by [filing an issue on our repo](https://github.com/PostHog/).

## What is HogQL?

HogQL is basically our take on SQL. 

Less basically, it's a transition layer over ClickHouse SQL that we've created to empower a wide range of users, from technical product managers who need multi-property breakdowns, to engineers who need to dissect data in more nuanced ways. It's intuitive for teams who are familiar with SQL, but offers a few extra advantages and features.

Unique features to HogQL include simplified access to event and person properties, as well as the ability to run subqueries and database joins. You can also use aggregations, such as `count`, `min`, `minIf`, `max`, `maxIf`, `sum`, `sumIf`, `avg`, `any`, and `anyIf`.

We recommend checking the docs for a more detailed [explanation of ClickHouse SQL functions which are supported in HogQL](/manual/hogql).

## HogQL expressions

A frequent request from teams using PostHog has been the ability to breakdown insight results across multiple properties. To accomodate this, we've added the ability to use HogQL expressions within an insight breakdown - so you can breakdown results however you like. 

Using HogQL expressions enables you to combine the speed of PostHog's existing insights, with the flexibility of HogQL - the best of both worlds!

## The PostHog event explorer 

In addition to introducing HogQL, we've also upgraded the event explorer (previously known as the Live events tab) to give you more ways to filter events and analyze your data.

The new event explorer view also enables you to view source behind queries, then use HogQL to create custom views. Below, for example, you can see a query we wrote using HogQL which summarizes [votes from our 404 page](/hedgehogsgalore).

```
{
  "kind": "DataTableNode",
  "full": true,
  "source": {
    "kind": "EventsQuery",
    "select": [
      "properties.$geoip_country_name",
      "if(countIf(properties.does_pineapple_go_on_pizza == 'false') > countIf(properties.does_pineapple_go_on_pizza == 'true'), 'üçÖ Does not belong on pizza', if(countIf(properties.does_pineapple_go_on_pizza == 'false') == countIf(properties.does_pineapple_go_on_pizza == 'true'), 'ü•¶ It is a tie' , 'üçç Belongs on pizza')) -- Result",
      "concat(repeat('üçç', countIf(properties.does_pineapple_go_on_pizza == 'true')),repeat('üçÖ', countIf(properties.does_pineapple_go_on_pizza == 'false'))) -- Answers",
      "count() -- Number of answers",
      "concat(toString(round(countIf(properties.does_pineapple_go_on_pizza == 'true') / count() * 1000) / 10), '%') -- Percentage pineapple"
    ],
    "after": "-365d",
    "limit": 100,
    "event": "pineapple_on_pizza_survey",
    "orderBy": [
      "-count() # Number of answers"
    ],
    "before": ""
  },
  "propertiesViaUrl": true
}
```

## The history and future of HogQL

We originally started thinking about HogQL back in January, while thinking about [a concept for universal search within PostHog](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog/issues/7963). Over time, that plan evolved into creating [new ways for users to explore data](https://github.com/PostHog/meta/issues/86) via direct queries. We wanted users to be able to run formulas powered by HogQL in what was then called the Live Events view, but is now the Event Explorer. 

However, while this work was underway we realized we could potentially take it a step further and build full SQL support directly into PostHog as a new insight type. You'd simply write a new SQL query in PostHog, press 'Run' and get a table with your desired results. 

We're still actively developing these ideas, as well as the implementation of HogQL within PostHog. If you have any feedback, we'd love to here from you in [the PostHog Slack group](/slack).
